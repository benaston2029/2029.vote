# Privacy Policy
Project 2029 is a grassroots movement, set up by Ben Aston, with the aim of developing an effective Reform UK Get Out The Vote operation for Bournemouth West in the 2029 general election.

This Privacy Policy describes how and when Project 2029 collects, uses, and shares information.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third parties that Project 2029 does not own or control.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
In order for us to keep in touch with us, you must provide us with certain information such as your name and email address. You may also choose to provide us with additional personal information if you choose to do so.

## 2. WHY WE NEED YOUR INFORMATION & HOW WE USE IT
We rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:

- as needed to provide services, such as when we use your information to keep you informed of local grassroots activism events or to provide support;


- when you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for a mailing list;


- if necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law;


- as necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as providing and improving our services.


## 3. INFORMATION SHARING & DISCLOSURE
We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:

- Service providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services such as email sending. We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.


- Compliance with laws. We may collect, use, retain, and share your information if it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal or government requests; (b) enforce agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, or solve technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of customers, or others.


- Data Retention. We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with services and as described in our Privacy Policy. However, we may also be required to retain this information to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce agreements. We generally keep your data for up to seven years (as required by UK tax law).


- Transfers of Personal Information Outside the EU. We may store and process your information through third-party hosting services in the US and other jurisdictions. 


## 4. YOUR RIGHTS
If you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below:

### Access
You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information below.

### Change, restrict, delete
You may also have rights to change, restrict use of, or delete your personal information. Apart from exceptional circumstances (like where we are required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal information upon request.

### Object
You can object to (i) processing of some of your information based on legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from us after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, We will delete your personal information unless we have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.

### Complain
If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.


## 5. HOW TO CONTACT US
For purposes of EU and UK data protection law, Ben Aston is the data controller of your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns, you may email us at: privacy@2029.vote.
